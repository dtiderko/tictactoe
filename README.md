# TicTacToe

## Requirements

- Haskell2010
- cabal
- `ncurses-devel`

## Running the game

Start the game with this command inside the root of this project:

```bash
cabal run
```

Then you can play the game using your mouse. Or if you're extra fancy, you can use the following keys:
- arrow keys to move the selection
- enter / space to claim a field
- q / CTRL+C to exit
